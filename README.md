# Comparing-8-Puzzle-Solving-Algorithms
In the notebook, I compare a variety of search algorithms paired with a variety of heuristics used to estimate different board configurations' distance from 
the solution state. The 8-puzzle game itself as well as all algorithms are developed from scratch; no external libraries are used.
